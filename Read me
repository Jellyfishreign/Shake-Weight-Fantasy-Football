# The Quantum Gauntlet - Playoff Dashboard

A real-time visualization dashboard for fantasy football playoff data from the Sleeper API. This application provides a beautiful, modern web interface that automatically updates with live playoff data.

## Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Data automatically refreshes every minute via WebSocket connections
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with smooth animations and hover effects
- **Multiple Views**: Separate tabs for each playoff week and combined statistics
- **Live Standings**: Real-time team standings with position badges
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Screenshots

The dashboard includes:
- **Standings View**: Shows all teams with their playoff positions and pre-total scores
- **Week 14**: Bye teams, playoff teams, and wildcard teams performance
- **Week 15**: Updated performance data for all playoff groups
- **Combined 14+15**: Combined scores from weeks 14 and 15
- **Week 16**: Conference championship, purgatory, and toilet bowl
- **Week 17**: Final championship, purgatory, and toilet bowl results

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Access to the Sleeper API
- Google Sheets credentials (for the original data export functionality)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your credentials**:
   - Update the `username` variable in `app.py` with your Sleeper username
   - Update the `target_league_name` variable with your league name
   - If you want to keep the Google Sheets functionality, ensure your credentials file is in the correct path

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the dashboard**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Configuration

### Sleeper API Settings

Edit the following variables in `app.py`:

```python
username = "LactatingLtinas"  # Your Sleeper username
season = "2024"               # NFL season
target_league_name = "The League To Be Named Later"  # Your league name
```

### Update Frequency

The application updates data every 60 seconds by default. You can modify this in the `background_update()` function:

```python
time.sleep(60)  # Change this value to adjust update frequency
```

## File Structure

```
├── app.py                    # Main Flask application
├── templates/
│   └── index.html           # Web interface template
├── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
├── README.md               # This file
└── The_Quantum_Gauntlet_Import.py  # Original data processing script
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: The application fetches data from the Sleeper API for all playoff weeks
2. **Processing**: Processes the data using the same logic as your original script
3. **Real-time Updates**: Uses WebSocket connections to push updates to connected clients
4. **Visualization**: Displays the data in an organized, tabbed interface

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Main dashboard page
- `GET /api/data`: JSON endpoint for current data
- WebSocket: Real-time data updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"League not found" error**:
   - Verify your `username` and `target_league_name` are correct
   - Ensure you have access to the league

2. **Connection errors**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the Sleeper API is accessible

3. **Port already in use**:
   - Change the port in `app.py`: `socketio.run(app, debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)`

### Debug Mode

The application runs in debug mode by default. For production, set `debug=False` in the `socketio.run()` call.

## Customization

### Styling

The dashboard uses CSS custom properties and can be easily customized by modifying the styles in `templates/index.html`.

### Data Structure

The application processes data into the following structure:

```python
{
    'timestamp': '12/15/2024 14:30 CST',
    'week14': {
        'bye': [{'team': '(1) Team Name', 'score': '125.50'}],
        'playoff': [...],
        'wildcard': [...]
    },
    'week15': {...},
    'combined': {...},
    'week16': {...},
    'week17': {...},
    'standings': [{'seed': 1, 'team': 'Team Name', 'position': 'Bye', 'pre_total': '1500.25'}]
}
```
